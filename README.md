About three years I woke up to an article about Gumroad. Normally, I like these sorts of days. But this one was about me laying off the vast majority of my company. On top of that, I had to answer a lot of emails and tweets from our creators–many asking if they should start looking for an alternative.

Five years before that, I had left my job at Pinterest–before I vested any of my stock–and started what I thought would be a billion-dollar company. My life’s work.

Now I was a public failure. In hindsight, I think I deserved it.

@shl: Just had an idea for my first billion-dollar company. Tomorrow, I start building it.

Two days later, I launched Gumroad on Hacker News. (This was before Product Hunt.)

The reaction seemed to match my grand aspirations: It was number one for the day, and about 50,000 people checked it out. Fast-forward a few months, and I’ve raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, First Round Capital, and more.

(I’ve realized since then that an all-star cast couldn’t have been all-male and almost all-White, but at the time it certainly felt like one.)

A few months after that, I raised $7M more. I guess I didn’t have enough dudes involved already. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins, a top-tier VC firm, led the round.

I was on top of the world. I was a single founder, 19 years old, with over $8M in the bank and just three employees.

Not much changed when we raised money. Most of the pressure is self-inflicted, in my opinion. Investors are busy chasing the next deal before yours closes, and your board members will never care nearly as much as you do. We started to grow the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers quickly started to climb.

So what went wrong, and when? Let’s start with the numbers. Here they are, up until the layoffs:


That’s our monthly processed volume. We took about 5% as our cut, so our revenue roughly matched that. It doesn’t look too bad, right? It’s up and to the right.

But we weren’t a lifestyle business–we were venture-funded, which is like a game of double-or-nothing. And we weren’t doubling fast enough to raise the $15M+ Series B we were looking for–that we needed to fund the team, office, and everything else.

How I looked at it then: it’s okay. We have money in the back, we have product-market fit. We’re going to keep shipping product and things will work out.

How I look at it now: Wow. We hit a peek in November and stalled. We had a lot of creators that absolutely loved us–but there weren’t enough of them who needed our specific product offering. Product-market fit is great, but we need to find a new fit (and then a new one, and again).

If I could go back in time, I would have shrunk the team then. Every month of less than 20% growth should have been a red flag. But hindsight is 20/20, and things always looked like they were about to change, right around the corner.

Falling in Style

Let me get this out of the way: I do not regret raising venture capital. It allowed us to ship a product offering far better than anything else on the market. It allowed me to build and learn from a world-class team.

And our investors are great. I’ve heard horror stories, but mine is not one of them. Here’s an example: when we knew we were entering dire straits, Mike Abbott, our partner from KPCB, told us that they would support us with a $2M bridge if we failed to raise money, giving us about an extra nine months of runway. That way, I could focus on fundraising for the current trajectory, instead of having to reset the company now–and make that virtually impossible. VCs are like sharks: they can smell blood. (Except they don’t pounce, they run away.)

We had three weeks of runway when they wired the money. I trusted them, and they came through.

So I told the team in January of 2015: the road ahead was going to be a tough one. We didn’t have the numbers to raise a series B and we would have to work really hard over the next nine months to get them. If we got them, we’d be good. If we didn’t…

Slim down or shut down?

There were a few options:

Shut down the business, return the money left to investors, and try something new.
Continue operating a slimmed-down version of the company.
Try to position the company for an acquihire.

Some of my investors wanted me to shut down the business. My time was worth more than working on a business like Gumroad, and I should try to build another billion-dollar company armed with all of my learnings–and their money.

We talked to a few potential acquirers. No one was that interested in keeping the product alive.

Every so often I get some comment along the lines of: “it’s so cool that you had the determination to slim down instead of just shut down.”

But it wasn’t some grand selfless act. It was the only choice. I was responsible for our creators, our employees, and our investors in that order. And we were helping thousands of creators get paid. About $2,500,000 a month was going to go into the pockets of creators. Went towards rent checks and mortgages, student loans and kids’ college funds. And it was only growing! Could I really just turn that faucet off?

I shrunk the company from 20 to five. We found a new tenant for our $25,000/month office and launched a premium service.

June 2015:

Revenue: $89,000
Gross profit: $17,000
Operating expenses: $364,000
Net profit: -$351,000

June 2016:

Revenue: $176,000
Gross profit: $42,000
Operating expenses: $32,000
Net profit: +$10,000

We did it. We were in control of our destiny. What next?

Skeleton crew to lifestyle business

The next couple years were much worse than any of the ones that came before it.

Even in those nine months, when the whole team knew that we were fighting for our company’s life, not a single person left Gumroad. From “this is gonna be hard” to “yep, turns out it was,” every single person worked harder than ever. Some folks even worked on Gumroad through their entire severance–meant to give them the flexibility to find a new gig.

I will forever be grateful for them.

Now, I was basically alone. I didn’t have a team, nor an office. And San Francisco was full of startups raising gobs more money, building amazing teams and shipping great products. Some of my friends became billionaires. Meanwhile, I was running a measly lifestyle-business.

Our liquidation preferences meant that we would have to sell the business for over $16M to see a single dollar come to common stockholders (me and the employees, mostly)–several years away if even possible. But I still had to keep the ship from sinking.

So, every day, I woke up and took care of all of Gumroad’s support queries. I tried to fix all of the bugs I could. Often, I had to ask for help from former Gumroad engineers. They always helped.  Then I tried to go to the gym, and work on a side project (a fantasy novel). Most days, I failed. Most days, I smoked a lot of weed.

I wouldn’t say I was depressed because I don’t think I deserve to use that word. But from the outside looking in, I was not in a great state.

Then Trump won the election. Long story short, I left San Francisco.

Then one day, everything changed. I’m wary about sharing this part of the story, because I don’t know if there is anything to learn from it. But it happened, so here it is:

A little over a year ago, Kleiner Perkins wrote off their position in Gumroad entirely.

After Mike Abbott left KPCB–and therefore Gumroad’s board–to start a company, they let me know that it made more sense financially and operationally to write off the investment. Gumroad bought back their share for $1.

In one fell swoop, Gumroad went from about $16.5M in liquidation preferences to $2.5M. All of a sudden, there was a light at the end of the tunnel. Small, dim, and far away, but present.

One investor joined them. A couple more since, we’ve bought back. The rest I keep up-to-date with a brief email every few months.

Failing to capture value

At a CEO Summit many years ago, my all-time hero was on stage: Bill Gates. Someone asked him: how do you deal with failing to capture so much value? Microsoft was huge, sure, but tiny compared to the total impact it has had on the world–and on humanity.

Bill’s answer: sure, but that’s true with all companies, right? They create some value, and succeed in capturing a very small percentage of it.

That will always stick with me.

While Gumroad may be small, our impact is large. There is, of course, the $175,000,000 that we’ve sent to creators. But then there’s the impact of the impact, the opportunities that those creators have had and taken to create new opportunities for others. The ripple effect will continue, for as long as humans exist.

So my ambition is the same, but different. I still want to have as large an impact as possible. But I’m okay not creating it directly. I don’t need proof of it anymore, in the form of my company’s revenue or valuation. 

For example, I opened up our financials.

Releasing numbers is scary: what if we don’t grow every month? And I would never ask or expect a venture-backed startup to do it, because when you’re raising money, hiring people, competing for customers, it makes sense to hold those cards as close to your chest as possible.

It’s had the opposite effect for us though. More investors have reached out (we’re just interested in raising money from our customers for the moment, thanks!), more folks want to contribute to Gumroad, and it’s gotten us closer to our creators too.

At first, I was worried they’d freak out about how small Gumroad actually is–and leave for greener pastures. But instead, they’ve grown more loyal. We’re in this together, all of us just trying to do earn a living doing something that we love.

We are also going to open source the whole product, WordPress-style. We’re going to fail at capturing much of the value we’re going to create, and that’s okay.

Lessons learned

There were many months where I worked 16 hours a day. Some, I worked four hours a week. Here they are:



Can you tell which is which? I can’t. We had a sales team for a big chunk of that, then we didn’t. Can you tell when we made the switch?

I can’t. It seems like for better or worse, Gumroad grows at its own rate.

So instead of pretending to be a product visionary, trying to build a billion-dollar company, I am just focused on making Gumroad better and better for our existing creators. Because they kept us alive.

It also means I’m not working crazy hours on Gumroad anymore. I don’t think I have to. Instead, I’m trying to build out a process where I am not to bottleneck, and as long as we have the profits to do so, people can contribute–and get paid for contributing–to Gumroad. No equity, no perks. Just a pure, honest, low-stress value-exchange.

Seeking the non-binary

I failed to build a billion-dollar company, but I did build something I am proud of. I learned a lot. I am excited about what we’re shipping for creators this year. And I’m okay with creating value outside of just our revenue-generating product, too.

I was misguided from the onset; building a billion-dollar company is a terrible goal. It’s completely arbitrary, and doesn’t accurately reflect impact.

I’m not making an excuse, or pretending that I didn’t fail. Or pretending that it feels good. I did fail. And even though everyone knows the failure rate is super high, it still sucks when you do.

And don’t get me wrong: I would absolutely love if Gumroad were a billion-dollar company. I don’t mind 80-hour weeks. In fact, I love them.

But I’m okay with where I’m at. There is tremendous freedom in running a profitable, and growing, software business. It’s a freedom I think everyone deserves to find–or at least, to know about.

So that’s my path to not building a billion-dollar company. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
